# Substrate

Substrate is a high-performance scripting engine & language for data-driven Java applications.

Subscript, the language implemented by Substrate, is a functional programming language designed for scripting in Java
applications. It is intentionally designed to not directly interface with Java classes, allowing for secure scripting
within applications.

It supports user-defined macros and functions, allowing it to be used as a DSL.
